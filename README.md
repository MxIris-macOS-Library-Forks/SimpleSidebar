# SimpleSidebar
Two implementations of the macOS sidebar:

- **Cocoa** (OS X 10.10 and later)
- **SwiftUI** (macOS 10.15 and later)

Although SwiftUI has made it a breeze to implement, I've always found the process to be far more complex than it needs to be when working with Cocoa.

Since I'm constantly developing newer applications with SwiftUI – yet also maintaining older projects that require maximum OS compatibility – I thought it would be useful to have a resource that portrays both implementations.
